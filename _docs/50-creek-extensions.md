Creek may have initially been developed to work with Kafka, but it was designed to be extended! 
Extended to support other data formats on Kafka, 
like the upcoming [JSON support](https://github.com/creek-service/creek-kafka/issues/25), 
and to support different external services, such as databases or cloud services.

It's early days, but we're hopeful other, internally developed, extensions to Creek will be built, 
as well as extensions developed and shared by the community. 

Organisations and users can, of course, also develop extensions to suit their specific needs and internal technologies.

If you'd like to create your own extension to Creek, then read on to the following pages:
