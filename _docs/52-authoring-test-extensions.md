This page will magically appear once the following task is complete:
[creek-system-test issue #20](https://github.com/creek-service/creek-system-test/issues/20).

Until then, the API exposed to test extensions is defined in the
[Creek System-test extension module](https://github.com/creek-service/creek-system-test/tree/main/extension) on GitHub,
and an example of a test extension can be found in the
[Kafka test extension](https://github.com/creek-service/creek-kafka/tree/main/test-extension).

[todo]: add link to extension-template if/when created.
