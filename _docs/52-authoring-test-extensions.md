How to author creek test extensions hasn't been documented yet.
The work to document it is tracked under [creek-system-test issue #20](https://github.com/creek-service/creek-system-test/issues/20).

Until then, the API exposed to test extensions is defined in the
[Creek System-test extension module](https://github.com/creek-service/creek-system-test/tree/main/extension) on GitHub,
and an example of a test extension can be found in the
[Kafka test extension](https://github.com/creek-service/creek-kafka/tree/main/test-extension).
