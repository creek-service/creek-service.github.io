This page will magically appear once the following task is completed:
[creek-service issue #28](https://github.com/creek-service/creek-service/issues/28).

Until then, the API exposed to extensions is defined in the 
[Creek Service API module](https://github.com/creek-service/creek-service/tree/main/api) on GitHub,
and an example of an extension can be found in the 
[Kafka client extension](https://github.com/creek-service/creek-kafka/tree/main/client-extension). 

[todo]: add link to extension-template if/when created.
