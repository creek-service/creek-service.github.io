Put simple, Creek helps users and organisations quickly develop business functionality, 
utilising a microservice architecture, running on top of Apache Kafkaâ„¢ and other external services.

The quickest way to get up and running is to try out a Creek tutorial!
The following tutorials provide a great introduction to what Creek is all about:

* [Basic Kafka Streams Tutorial]({{ "/basic-kafka-streams-demo" | relative_url }})
* More coming soon...
  
If you'd rather dive right in, then take a look at the [aggregate template][aggTemplate], 
which can help you quickly boostrap a new repository, ready for developing Creek microservices.
