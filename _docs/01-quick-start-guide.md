description: Get up and running with Creek quickly. Creek provides an opinionated way of quickly developing and testing Kafka based microservices.

Put simple, Creek helps users and organisations quickly develop business functionality, 
utilising a microservice architecture, running on top of Apache KafkaÂ® and other external services.

If you're new to Creek, then we'd suggest one of this three approaches to getting started.
Ordered by simplicity, with the easiest at the top:

1. **Try out a tutorial**. For example the Creek equivalent of a _Hello World_ app: the
   [Basic Kafka Streams Tutorial](/basic-kafka-streams-demo/),
   or head on over to the [Tutorials page](/tutorials/) for a full list, or
2. **Use a template repository**: Dive into the Creek [aggregate template repository](/aggregate-template/). 
   Let the template do all the hard work of bootstrapping and configuring a new repository, 
   ready to develop, build and test your microservices, 
   (how to use the template repo is covered in the [Basic Kafka Streams Tutorial](/basic-kafka-streams-demo/)), or
3. **Create your own template repository**: Clone and customise the Creek [aggregate template repository](/aggregate-template/),
   to better meet your organisations needs.
4. **Wait for docs**: Wait for use to get around to [writing docs for manually adding Creek to a repository](https://github.com/creek-service/creek-service.github.io/issues/30).
5. **Unpick the aggregate template**: Use the Creek [aggregate template repository](/aggregate-template/) as documentation 
   of how to manually add Creek to an existing project.
