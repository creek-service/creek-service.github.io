Creek is an opinionated way of building *and testing* an ecosystem of interconnected microservices.
While currently very much Kafka focused, Creek is built from the group up to be extendable.

Being originally focused on Kafka Streams based microservices... a *creek* is a small, a.k.a. micro, stream.
