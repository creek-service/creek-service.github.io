Creek is an opinionated way of building *and testing* an ecosystem of interconnected microservices.
While currently very much Kafka focused, Creek is built from the group up to be [extendable][1].

## What's with the name?

Being originally focused on Kafka Streams based microservices... a *creek* is a small stream. 
From small stream we get micro stream, then streams based microservice. Ta da!
