After a long wait, due to other commitments, I'm happy to announce the release of the second tutorial in the quick-start series:
the [Kafka Streams connected services tutorial]({{ "/ks-connected-services-demo/" | relative_url }}) is now live!

This follows on from basics covered in the [Basic Kafka Streams tutorial]({{ "/basic-kafka-streams-demo/" | relative_url }}).
Work will now start on the third, and final, part of the quick-start tutorials. This work is tracked under 
[issue-259 <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>](https://github.com/creek-service/creek-kafka/issues/259){:target="_blank"}.

Combined, its hoped these three tutorials will provide a great introduction to the power of Creek and how to use it
to build a tested, reliable microservice architecture quickly.

I'll let you know once the third quick-start tutorial is up...
