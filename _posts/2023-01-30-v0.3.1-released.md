The v0.3.1 patch release of Creek is now publicly available on Maven Central.

This small patch contains a few dependency updates to fix some security vulnerabilities in dependencies.
Nothing really worth calling out as being fixed, as its mostly stuff that wouldn't affect their use in Creek.

However, I will call out a few of the remaining 'vulnerabilities' in Creek dependencies.

### Snake YAML's Deserialization of Untrusted Data

See [CVE-2022-1471](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-1471) & 
[GHSA-mjmj-j48q-9wg2](https://github.com/google/security-research/security/advisories/GHSA-mjmj-j48q-9wg2).

At the time of writing, this was marked with `High` / `Critical` priority. However, if you [read up on the 
vulnerability](https://bitbucket.org/snakeyaml/snakeyaml/issues/561/cve-2022-1471-vulnerability-in), 
you'll see the vulnerability is that the deserializer allows instantiation or arbitrary types, and this
can lead to remote code execution _if_ you're parsing YAML from an untrustworthy source, e.g. text submitted
from a form on a website.

**This is not an issue for Creek, as all YAML being deserialized is from a trusted source, i.e. you, the 
user, running Creek system tests written in YAML.**

SnakeYaml isn't used directly by Creek. Creek makes use of it via Jackson. Fixing this (none) issue in Creek is not currently possible.

### Jackson core's Uncontrolled Resource Consumption

See [sonatype-2022-6438](https://ossindex.sonatype.org/vulnerability/sonatype-2022-6438?component-type=maven&component-name=com.fasterxml.jackson.core/jackson-core).

At the time of writing, this is marked with `High` priority. However, if you 
[read up on this vulnerability](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-core/issues/861), this is also about parsing
data from untrustworthy source.

**This is not an issue for Creek, as all data being deserialized is from a trusted source, i.e. you, the
user, running Creek system tests written in YAML.**

There is already a [fix in Jackson](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-core/pull/827). Creek will update to `2.15.0` 
of Jackson when it is released.

### Kafka Stream's divide by zero

See [sonatype-2019-0422](https://ossindex.sonatype.org/vulnerability/sonatype-2019-0422)

This seems to be a vulnerability detected by SonaType OSS Index scanning a [PR](https://github.com/apache/kafka/pull/7414) that fixed a potential divide-by-zero issue. 
The PR was never merged, hence the vulnerability report. However, from the PR comments it looks as though this issue is unlikely, or even impossible, to be hit.

[An issue](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA-14660) has been raised to track a potential fix.  
Creek will be updated should a fix become available.


### Sign off

As for continuing work on Creek: my focus is currently elsewhere for the next month or two, 
but I will get to those tutorials soon, and will post when I do!
