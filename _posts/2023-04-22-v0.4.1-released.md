The v0.4.1 patch release of Creek is now publicly available on Maven Central and the Gradle plugin portal.

Outside the usual dependency updates, the reason for the release was to publish enhancements to our Gradle plugins to 
support Gradle 8, and to fix an issue in the JSON schema plugin that was causing it to generate duplicate schemas.

Fixes and improvements:
 - (Json Schema: Gradle): ðŸŽ‰ [Gradle 8.x support <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>](https://github.com/creek-service/creek-json-schema-gradle-plugin/pull/116){:target="_blank"}
 - (Json Schema: Gradle): :beetle: [Fix module whitelisting <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>](https://github.com/creek-service/creek-json-schema-gradle-plugin/pull/123){:target="_blank"}
 - (System Test: Gradle): ðŸŽ‰ [Gradle 8.x support <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>](https://github.com/creek-service/creek-system-test-gradle-plugin/pull/142){:target="_blank"}.

Release dependency updates:
 - Bump Slf4j from 2.0.6 to 2.0.7.
 - Bump TestContainers from 1.17.6 to 1.18.0.
 - Bump info.picocli:picocli from 4.7.1 to 4.7.3.

Outside of doing this release, time is being spent investigating and comparing the different JVM-based JSON Schema validator libraries.
This will drive the decision on which validator library to use for the new 
[JSON SerDe <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>](https://github.com/creek-service/creek-kafka/issues/25){:target="_blank"}, 
which is also being worked on.

We'll let you know when the comparison is complete and share the results.
