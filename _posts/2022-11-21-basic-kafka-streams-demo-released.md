Following on from the [first public release of Creek]({% post_url 2022-11-15-v0.2.0-released %}), the first tutorial 
is now available :smile:.

The [Basic Kafka Streams Tutorial]({{ "/basic-kafka-streams-demo" | relative_url }}) gives a walk through of 
how Creek can help organisations quickly develop _and test_ a Kafka Streams based microservice.

While working on the tutorial something that was thought complete was discovered not to be: code coverage reporting
from system tests. Picking this up now.

I'll let you know when it's done...
