The v0.3.2 patch release of Creek is now publicly available on Maven Central.

This small patch contains a few dependency updates to fix some security vulnerabilities in dependencies.
Nothing really worth calling out as being fixed, as its mostly stuff that wouldn't affect their use in Creek.

The same vulnerabilities still exist in Snake YAML and Jackson core as for the [0.3.1 release]({% post_url 2023-01-30-v0.3.1-released %}).
Creek will be updated once there are patches available for this. Neither are of real concern to Creek due to the way
the libraries are used in Creek.

Work has started on the next tutorial, which covers how to connect services together within the same aggregate.
We'll let you know when it is ready.
