Really happy to announce the v0.2.0 alpha release of Creek is now publicly available on Maven Central! :boom:
This may only be an alpha release, but it's the first public release and therefore a major milestone for the project.

The _core_ and _system-test_ functionality is getting close. At the moment, the _Kafka_ side only supports records 
with basic key and value types, like `long`, `String` and `double`. While this is pretty limiting, it's enough to 
allow us to throw together some initial tutorials / demos. These demos are what we'll be focusing on next, along 
with switching the existing GitHub based docs over to this site. 

Once a demo or two have been knocked out, giving people a taste of what Creek is all about, work will pivot back to 
those outstanding big ticket items. Items like [JSON support](https://github.com/creek-service/creek-kafka/issues/25)
and [Windowed key support](https://github.com/creek-service/creek-kafka/issues/43). These will really open Creek up
to real world applications.

We'll post again when those demos go live...
