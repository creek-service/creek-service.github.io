Creek allows users to quickly build an ecosystem of connected microservices.

Sorry, but this page is still under construction. 
Until it's done, you can view documentation on the Creek Kafka [GitHub repo](https://github.com/creek-service/creek-kafka),
or view the [quick start tutorial](https://www.creekservice.org/basic-kafka-streams-demo)

[todo]: replace with creek-kafka docs site.
